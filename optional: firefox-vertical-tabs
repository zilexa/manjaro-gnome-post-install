/* OPTIONAL: NOT INCLUDED IN THE POST-INSTALL.SH SCRIPT */
/* Remove the horizontal tabbar and vertical titlebar to get a much more useful vertical tabbar. */
/* Why? Because you have more space in width than height on a monitor. */
/* And most websites are oriented vertically, creating lots of empty space on the sides, where your vertical tabbar will reside. */

/**/
/* HOW TO USE: */
/* First get the vertical tabbar: Install Sidebery addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/sidebery/ */
/* To remove the horizontal tabbar and the sidebar-title section, this file needs to be placed in your profile. */
/*
/*   STEP 1. Go to about:config and find toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets set it to TRUE by doubleclicking it. */
/*   STEP 2. Go to about:profiles, locate the current profile and open the root folder of your profile. */
/*   STEP 3. Create a folder here called "chrome" */
/*   STEP 4. Copy this file into that folder (../chrome/userChrome.css) and restart Firefox. */
/*   STEP 5. Note now you are missing the window buttons (minimize, maximize, close window):
/*           Right click empty-space next to the address bar and either do A or B, see which one you like. 
             A: Select "enable Menubar".
             B) select "Customize toolbar..", at the bottom left of this screen select "Enable Titlebar". */
