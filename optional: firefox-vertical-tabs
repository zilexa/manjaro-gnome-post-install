/* OPTIONAL: NOT INCLUDED IN THE POST-INSTALL.SH SCRIPT */
/* Remove the horizontal tabbar and vertical titlebar to get a much more useful vertical tabbar. */
/* Why? Because you have more space in width than height on a monitor. */
/* And most websites are oriented vertically, creating lots of empty space on the sides, where your vertical tabbar will reside. */

/**/
/* HOW TO USE: */
/* STEP 1. Install Sidebery addon for a vertical tab bar: https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/sidebery/ */
/* STEP 2. Go to about:config and find toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets set it to TRUE by doubleclicking it. */
/* STEP 3. Go to about:profiles and open the first folder of your profile. */
/* STEP 4. Create a folder here called 'chrome'. */
/* STEP 5. Copy this file into that folder (../chrome/userChrome.css) and restart Firefox. */

/* Actual file starts here */
